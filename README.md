# hello-world
My first GitHub repository.


This is just the first repository for me on GitHub. I'm just following the "Hello World" tutorial, so don't expect anything special!

Apparently I didn't follow the tutorial well enough, because I made a change to the README before I was instructed to. That's ok though.

I'm six feet tall, blonde hair, blue eyes. That's my description. I'm really looking forward to learning various programming languages over the next couple of years, and hopefully making a full-time career out of it!
